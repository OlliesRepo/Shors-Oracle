# ðŸ§® Modular Arithmetic for Shor's Algorithm (Beauregard 2003 Implementation)

Using only 1-qubit gates, multi-controlled phase (MCP) and X (MC X ) gates, this project implements the modular arithmetic subroutines needed for Shorâ€™s Algorithm using Beauregardâ€™s 2003 construction, which uses `2n + 3` qubits. All circuits are implemented in Python using Qiskit and include formal reasoning/proofs in Markdown cells above each function within the Jupyter Notebook. Each Circuit is drawn below it's function.

## ðŸ§  Theory

All functions are annotated with mathematical derivations or justifications for their correctness, derived directly from Beauregard's paper. This includes:

- Derivations of phase angles
- Modular arithmetic over the QFT basis
- Ancilla usage and reversible computation guarantees
